# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Internal:** Defined the controlled product and technical requirements for
  branded invoice PDFs, invoice delivery, secure customer access, managed
  company logos, and currency-safe dashboard ageing.
- **Internal:** Defined the iOS/Android mobile direction, camera-assisted
  document capture, Zimbabwe payment-provider strategy, governed WhatsApp
  integration, and advanced-capability role/permission model.

### Changed

- **Internal:** Dashboard and aged-receivables totals are now calculated with
  exact minor-unit arithmetic and displayed separately for USD and ZWG.

### Security

- **Internal:** Production startup now fails closed when the database URL or a
  strong JWT signing secret is missing. Platform-administrator seeding also
  requires an explicit non-placeholder password.
